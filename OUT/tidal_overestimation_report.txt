TIDAL OVERESTIMATION DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
==================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-08-17 02:40

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- Model tidal ranges: 5.6-7.5m
- Field observations: 2.1-3.2m
- Overestimation factor: 2-3x

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

1. MANNING FRICTION COEFFICIENT:
   Current Manning's n: 0.025
   Typical estuarine range: 0.020-0.035
   Suggested n for amplitude reduction: 0.062

2. GEOMETRY EFFECTS:
   - Check cross-sectional areas for realism
   - High convergence ratio may amplify tides
   - Verify bathymetry against field surveys

3. BOUNDARY FORCING:
   - Verify tidal amplitude at mouth (should match field)
   - Check phase relationships
   - Validate harmonic constituents

RECOMMENDED FIXES:

PRIORITY 1: Increase Manning friction coefficient
   - Change Manning's n from 0.025 to 0.062
   - Test sensitivity to friction values

PRIORITY 2: Validate geometry
   - Compare cross-sections with field surveys
   - Check for unrealistic convergence
   - Verify depth-area relationships

PRIORITY 3: Boundary condition verification
   - Confirm mouth tidal amplitude matches observations
   - Check upstream discharge consistency

VALIDATION TARGETS:
- Tidal range ratio: 0.8-1.2 (currently 2-3x)
- Phase relationships: Within Â±30 minutes
- Energy dissipation: Consistent with friction
