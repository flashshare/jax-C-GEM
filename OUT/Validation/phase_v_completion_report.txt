IDENTIFIED IMPROVEMENT AREAS
================================================================================

⚠️  1. PHOSPHATE ADSORPTION/DESORPTION (PIP: 13.27% mass loss)
   Status: Isolated to biogeochemistry module (not transport)
   Issue: Equilibrium balance between adsorption and desorption rates
   Evidence: Transport works perfectly (0.36% error when PIP disabled)
   Next Steps: Refine Langmuir isotherm parameters and equilibrium constants

⚠️  2. CARBONATE CHEMISTRY OSCILLATIONS (DIC, AT, ALKC)
   Status: Temporal variance > 1e6 indicates oscillations
   Issue: Coupling between DIC, AT, and ALKC derivatives
   Progress: 20% damping applied, further stabilization needed
   Next Steps: Implement more sophisticated pH buffering approach

⚠️  3. SALINITY MIXING PATTERNS (52 gradient sign changes)
   Status: Physically unrealistic but numerically stable
   Issue: Dispersion parameterization or boundary conditions
   Impact: Does not affect mass conservation or stability
   Next Steps: Optimize Van der Burgh dispersion parameters
