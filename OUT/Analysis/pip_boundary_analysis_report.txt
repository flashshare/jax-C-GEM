Generated: 2025-08-16 16:15:36

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
PIP Mass Loss: 45.33%
Total Mass Change: -1.08e+09
Net Boundary Flux: 1.87e+03 Â± 5.22e+04
Cumulative Boundary Loss: 3.23e+09

DETAILED FINDINGS
--------------------
1. BOUNDARY FLUX ANALYSIS:
   Upstream flux mean: -1.87e+03
   Downstream flux mean: 0.00e+00
   Net flux mean: 1.87e+03
   Net flux variability: 5.22e+04

2. INITIALIZATION EFFECTS:
   Initial mass: -2.39e+09
   Mass at 10% simulation: -1.56e+06
   Initialization period change: 2.39e+09
   Post-initialization change: -3.47e+09
   Initialization rate: 2.30e+03
   Post-initialization rate: -2.23e+03

3. SPATIAL PATTERNS:
   Upstream concentration: 35.893
   Downstream concentration: 25.870
   Downstream/Upstream ratio: 0.721

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TASK 17:
------------------------------
PRIMARY ISSUE: Initialization effects dominate mass loss
RECOMMENDED ACTION: Focus on equilibrium initialization

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement mass-conserving boundary conditions for PIP
2. Optimize TVD advection scheme for particulate transport
3. Enhance equilibrium initialization for PIP
4. Validate improvements with mass conservation tests
