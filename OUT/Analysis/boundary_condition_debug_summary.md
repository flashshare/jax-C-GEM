# BOUNDARY CONDITION IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS
============================================

## CRITICAL FINDINGS:

### Issue Identification:
- METHOD 14 & 15 show IDENTICAL results despite 10x-100x parameter changes
- NH4: 23.0 → 9.5 (boundary not preserved)
- TOC: 500.0 → 2.7 (99% depletion despite zero biogeochemistry)
- O2: 75.0 → 210.1 (overproduction despite zero photosynthesis)

### Root Cause Hypothesis:
Boundary condition files exist and contain correct values, but are not
properly applied during transport simulation.

## INVESTIGATION RESULTS:

1. **Boundary Files**: ✅ Exist and contain correct METHOD 13 values
2. **Data Loader**: ⚠️  May not be loading boundary conditions properly
3. **Transport Module**: ❌ May not be applying boundary conditions
4. **Engine Integration**: ❌ May not be passing BC to transport

## NEXT STEPS:

### Immediate Actions:
1. Debug data_loader boundary condition loading mechanism
2. Check transport.py boundary condition application code
3. Verify simulation_engine passes BC data to transport
4. Test with simplified boundary condition forcing

### Alternative Approach:
If boundary condition implementation is broken:
- Implement direct boundary forcing in transport solver
- Use initial conditions as boundary proxies
- Consider boundary condition restoration at each timestep

## VALIDATION STATUS:
- Current: 1/15 NSE criteria (6.7%)
- All biogeochemical fixes failed due to BC implementation issues
- Must resolve boundary condition application before further validation
