# METHOD 15 Verification Plan
=============================

## Immediate Tests:
1. Run simulation with METHOD 15 parameters
2. Check boundary vs simulation concentrations
3. Analyze biogeochemical process rates
4. Compare with field data ranges

## Success Criteria:
- TOC depletion reduced from 99% to <50%
- O2 overproduction reduced from 280% to <150%  
- NH4 boundary preservation improved
- At least 2/3 key species within reasonable ranges

## Next Steps if Successful:
- Run advanced statistical validation
- Check NSE improvements beyond 1/15 criteria
- Consider field data alignment for other species

## Next Steps if Failed:
- Consider boundary condition dominance approach
- Investigate direct boundary forcing mechanisms
- Review transport vs biogeochemical timescales
