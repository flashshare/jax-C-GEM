# JAX C-GEM Model Validation Report
==================================================

## Executive Summary

## Validation Results by Variable

## Interpretation and Recommendations

**Model Performance Assessment:**
- R² > 0.7: Excellent agreement
- R² 0.5-0.7: Good agreement
- R² 0.3-0.5: Moderate agreement
- R² < 0.3: Poor agreement

**Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency:**
- NSE > 0.7: Very good model performance
- NSE 0.5-0.7: Good model performance
- NSE 0.2-0.5: Satisfactory model performance
- NSE < 0.2: Unsatisfactory model performance

**Recommendations for Model Improvement:**
- Focus calibration on variables with poor performance
- Investigate systematic biases in residuals
- Consider additional processes if unexplained variance is high
- Increase observation frequency for better validation
