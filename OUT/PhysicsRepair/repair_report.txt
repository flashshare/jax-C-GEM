JAX C-GEM PHYSICS REPAIR SUMMARY
==================================================

1. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FIXED:
   - Upstream salinity: 0 PSU (freshwater)
   - Downstream salinity: 35 PSU (seawater)
   - Upstream nutrients: High (river input)
   - Downstream nutrients: Low (seawater)
   - Proper tidal forcing: ±4.43m amplitude

2. INITIAL CONDITIONS STABILIZED:
   - Smooth salinity gradient: 35→0 PSU
   - Proper nutrient gradients: High upstream
   - Realistic oxygen distribution

3. EXPECTED LONGITUDINAL PROFILES:
   - Salinity: Smooth 35→0 gradient downstream to upstream
   - NH4: Smooth ~5→150 gradient mouth to head
   - Tidal amplitude: Decay from 4.43m to ~0m

4. VALIDATION CRITERIA:
   - No oscillations in spatial profiles
   - Monotonic gradients
   - Physical realism
