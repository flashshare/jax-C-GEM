# JAX C-GEM Transport Fix - Deployment Report
==========================================

## Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESS

### Summary
Transport fix successfully deployed and validated

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Verification ✅
- Transport fix functionality verified
- Salinity gradient confirmed correct (high at mouth → low at head)
- Initial conditions validated

### Phase 2: Backup ✅  
- simulation_engine.py backed up to simulation_engine_backup.py
- Original code preserved for rollback if needed

### Phase 3: Integration ✅
- simulation_engine.py updated to use transport_step_corrected
- Import statements added for corrected transport function
- Function calls replaced throughout simulation engine

### Phase 4: Full Simulation Test
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Gradient Validation**: ✅ CORRECT

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Resolution
The original salinity gradient inversion was caused by incorrect order of operations:

**Original (Incorrect) Order**:
1. Advection 
2. Boundary Conditions ← Applied after advection
3. Dispersion

**C-GEM Correct Order**:
1. Boundary Conditions ← Applied before advection  
2. Advection
3. Dispersion

### Files Modified
- ✅ `src/core/transport_fixed.py` - Corrected transport physics
- ✅ `src/core/transport_corrected.py` - Integrated corrected module
- ✅ `src/core/simulation_engine.py` - Updated to use corrected transport
- ✅ `src/core/simulation_engine_backup.py` - Backup of original

### Key Functions
- `transport_step_corrected()` - Main corrected transport function
- `apply_cgem_boundary_conditions()` - Exact C-GEM boundary logic
- `cgem_tvd_advection()` - JAX-compatible TVD scheme

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Tests Completed
- ✅ Transport fix unit test (tools/validation/test_transport_fix.py)
- ✅ Integration test (tools/validation/integrate_transport_fix.py)  
- ✅ Full simulation test (current deployment)

### Performance Impact
- JAX compilation preserved
- No expected performance degradation
- Memory usage unchanged

## Results

### Salinity Gradient Validation
The fundamental issue - salinity gradient inversion - has been resolved:
- **Expected**: High salinity at mouth (ocean) → Low salinity at head (river)
- **Result**: CORRECT gradient maintained

## Next Steps

### If Deployment Successful ✅
1. Run extended simulation (50+ days) to validate long-term stability
2. Compare performance against original C-GEM benchmarks  
3. Update documentation with corrected physics order
4. Add automated regression tests

### If Issues Remain ❌
1. Review error logs in simulation output
2. Check transport_step_corrected integration points
3. Verify all function calls updated correctly
4. Consider rollback to simulation_engine_backup.py

## Conclusion

The JAX C-GEM transport physics fix addresses the core salinity gradient inversion issue by implementing the exact C-GEM order of operations. The deployment process ensures proper integration while maintaining code quality and performance.

**Final Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
