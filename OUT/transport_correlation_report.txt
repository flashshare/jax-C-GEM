TRANSPORT CORRELATION DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
=======================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-08-17 02:42

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- Most species show poor spatial correlation (R² = 0.125-0.367)
- O₂ shows good correlation (R² = 0.792)
- Need to understand why O₂ works while others fail

SPECIES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:

MASS CONSERVATION ANALYSIS:
   NH4: Rel. change=0.0025 - GOOD
   NO3: Rel. change=0.0360 - POOR
   PO4: Rel. change=0.0411 - POOR
   TOC: Rel. change=0.0340 - POOR
   O2: Rel. change=0.0855 - POOR
   S: Rel. change=0.7326 - POOR
   SPM: Rel. change=0.7246 - POOR

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

1. O₂ SUCCESS FACTORS:
   - May have more realistic boundary conditions
   - Reaeration provides stabilizing source term
   - Gas exchange equilibrium helps
   - Less sensitive to transport numerical errors

2. OTHER SPECIES FAILURE FACTORS:
   - Boundary condition values may be unrealistic
   - Dispersion coefficients may be inappropriate
   - Mass conservation violations
   - Strong sensitivity to transport errors

RECOMMENDED FIXES:

PRIORITY 1: Boundary condition validation
   - Verify upstream/downstream values against literature
   - Check for missing or corrupted boundary files
   - Compare boundary gradients with field observations

PRIORITY 2: Dispersion coefficient validation
   - Check if dispersion values are within estuarine range (10-1000 m²/s)
   - Verify Elder's formula implementation
   - Test sensitivity to dispersion magnitude

PRIORITY 3: Mass conservation fixes
   - Identify species with mass violations
   - Check numerical solver conservation properties
   - Verify boundary flux calculations

PRIORITY 4: Learn from O₂ success
   - Extract O₂ boundary condition patterns
   - Apply O₂ success factors to other species
   - Test other species with O₂-like boundary conditions

VALIDATION TARGETS:
- All species R² > 0.6 (currently only O₂ achieves this)
- Mass conservation error < 1% for all species
- Realistic boundary condition gradients
- Dispersion coefficients within 10-1000 m²/s range
